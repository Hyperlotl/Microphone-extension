# INFO:
Really cool extension that uses microphone to record audio in Turbowarp. Requires URL playback extension to work fully.
# INSTALLATION:
Just copy the extension.js file, and use "load custom extension" to load it into Turbowarp. MAKE SURE "RUN EXTENSION AS UNSANDBOXED" IS ENABLED!
NOTE: Due to how the live recording code works, any tab with the extension enabled will indicate that it is recording even when it is not. I will PROBABLY fix this in the future.
